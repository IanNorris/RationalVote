<p>We are not lawyers, so our privacy policy is written in plain English.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		We won't share your data with third parties. We will only use your email address for communications about the site and
		activities related to the site. A very small number of site administrators may have access to our databases directly,
		this will reveal your email address and a non-reversible version of your password (for those who want details we salt per user
		and use SHA256).
	</li>
	<li>
		We will take every reasonable precaution to keep your information secure. Such measures include but are not limited
		to keeping all servers up to date with all security updates, minimizing access to the server to only a very small
		number of site administrators, secure and strong passwords on all administrator and service accounts.
	</li>
	<li>
		We won't share information with government agencies unless compelled to do so by a signed court order or warrant.
	</li>
	<li>
		Our site is run entirely over a secure HTTP (HTTPS) connection, this is to protect your identity and safeguard your
		login details. This will help protect you from snooping by criminals and tyrannical governments.
	</li>
	<li>
		Our site uses cookies. These will only be used when necessary to allow our site to keep you logged in.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can request the information we hold on you if you can provide us with proof of identification. We may
		require a fee to do this depending on the amount of work involved and the number of requests we receive.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>We may need to update our privacy policy in the future, if we do this we will email you to let you know about the changes.</p>
