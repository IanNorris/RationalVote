</div>
<div class="modal-body" style="overflow: auto;height:600px">
<p>Because we are not lawyers, our terms of service are short and written in plain English. By using the site you agree to its terms.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		We agree to keep your information as secure as possible, but in return you agree that the password you use to access the site
		is unique (not used on any other site and not too simple). Failure to provide a secure password to our site (or to the email
		address that this account was registered) waives your expectation of
		your account information being kept secure. The account holder will be held responsible for any actions taken by their account
		in this scenario. In the situation where the account is held by a site moderator or administrator, this will be considered a
		severe breach of the terms of service and the user may have their privileges revoked. For this reason all site moderators and
		administrators must have strong passwords on both their accounts, and also the email addresses used for their site account.
	</li>
	<li>
		You agree to not post illegal, copyrighted, inflammatory, abusive or adult (including pornographic) content to our site. Doing
		so may result in you being banned from the service and or reported to local authorities where appropriate.
	</li>
	<li>
		By posting to the site you agree that the content you are posting is your own or in the public domain. By posting to the
		site you agree that you are permitting the community to use this content for any purpose they wish. This includes but is
		not limited to being used in a political manifesto, campaign literature, blogs and private correspondence. If you do not
		agree to this, do not post it.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may not deliberately negatively affect the experience of other users of the site. This includes but is not limited to
		posting 'spam', 'trolling', posting derogatory comments or off topic content (such as ASCII art, 'zalgo' and other Unicode characters
		designed to damage the user experience), attempting to slow the site down.
	</li>
	<li>
		You agree that all claims you make on the site are true and accurate. You must not misrepresent who you are in order to gain
		status on the site. This includes lying about your profession and or qualifications. You may of course not state either,
		which is perfectly acceptable if you are not comfortable sharing.
	</li>
	<li>
		In conversations where such a request has been made, you may advertise or promote a service that you personally endorse. If you
		are affiliated with the service or organization that provides it, you must disclose this within the post. If an endorsement is
		made, you may include a link (when linking is permitted), but please clarify if it is a link with automated referral tracking.
		Please also check before sharing these links if you are permitted to do so on a public forum.
	</li>
	<li>
		This is a debate site and conversations can get quite heated; but we ask that you please keep it civil and keep on topic.
		Abusive or threatening comments towards other members (or non-members) will not be tolerated. Claims of intent to commit
		violence of any kind will get you banned and also reported to the authorities.
	</li>
	<li>
		Although we will make every effort to moderate the content posted by our users, we accept that this is a fairly impossible task
		and that with our limited resources we are likely to miss inappropriate content. As such we cannot be held responsible for the
		content posted by our users, but if contacted we can remove the offending content if this is an appropriate action.
		This includes copyright takedown notices. You may contact us using the details provided at the Contact Us page.
	</li>
	<li>
		We encourage our tech savvy members to help keep the site secure.
		If you wish to perform penetration testing on the site or its services, you may do so if you have contacted us (and received a response)
		beforehand outlining our terms. We unfortunately cannot provide a cash bounty as our services are currently run at a loss.
		Attempting to hack or breach the site security without our prior permission will not be tolerated. This includes denial of service (DoS)
		and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS).
	</li>
	<li>
		The group, site, administrators and anyone else associated with the organization may not be held accountable for any issues that may
		arise from the use or misuse of the site, or by any action or inaction taken by our staff, organization or representatives.
		You agree that you waive your rights to legal action against the aforementioned as far as permitted by law.
	</li>
	<li>
		We cannot be held liable for inability to provide service or for any data loss that may occur. We will strive to keep the service
		running but we provide no guarantees or service-level Agreement (SLA).
	</li>
</ol>

<p>At our discretion we may terminate the accounts or access to our services of members or visitors that do not abide by our terms of service.</p>
